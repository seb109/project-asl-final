# ASL Sign Language Detection ðŸ¤Ÿ

This project is focused on building a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) detection system using computer vision and deep learning. The goal is to enable seamless communication between deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals and the hearing world by translating ASL gestures into readable text.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- Deep learning model trained on ASL datasets
- Live prediction display with confidence score
- Custom data collection pipeline for new signs

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)
- NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas (for data handling and visualization)
